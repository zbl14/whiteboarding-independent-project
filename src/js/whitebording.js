// Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs
// URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

// You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

// Example
// Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

// Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

export const stringToUrls = (str) => {
  if (str === "") return "";
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (str[i] === " ") {
      const left = str.substring(0, i);
      const right = str.substring(i + 1);
      str = left + "%20" + right;
    }
  }
  return str;
};

// Question #2: Array Deduping
// Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

// Example
// Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi" 7, 53]

// Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

// Question #3: Compressing Strings
// Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

// Example
// Input: "aaabccdddda"

// Output: "3ab2c4da"

// Question #4: Checking for Uniqueness
// Write an algorithm that determines whether all the elements in a string are unique. You may not convert the string into an array or use array methods to solve this problem. The algorithm should return a boolean.

// Example
// Input: "hello"

// Output: false

// Input: "copyright"

// Output: true

// Question #5: Array Sorting
// Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms — take the time to read about the following:

// Quick sort
// Merge sort
// Heap sort
// Insertion sort
// Bubble sort
// Selection sort
// You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem — as long as it doesn't use sort().

// Example
// Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

// Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]
